  "body": "In targeting a longstanding indoor 800 meter record, Josh Hoey faces a critical pacing decision during his upcoming pursuit. The indoor track presents unique demands with its tighter turns and shorter straights, meaning each lap must be carefully measured. With the pressure mounting and limited races left in the season, Hoey will need to decide whether to start aggressively or conserve energy for a strong finish, a balance that could make or break his chance at a record decades old.\n\nFor runners striving to improve, Hoey's situation highlights the importance of strategy in races beyond raw speed. Adapting your effort throughout a race based on how the event unfolds requires mindfulness and restraint. Whether training for competition or just pushing your personal limits, learning when to hold back and when to surge can lead to more consistent results and less burnout over time.",
  "keyTakeaway": "Practice adjusting your pace deliberately during runs to develop a sense of when to conserve energy and when to accelerate for sustained performance.",
