This decision came as the team aimed to maximize readiness before a major race under tight timing constraints. Their choice to focus on environment, rather than only workouts, marks a deliberate effort to cultivate confidence through tailored surroundings.\n\nFor runners at any level, this highlights how confidence can grow not just from physical training but also from making thoughtful decisions about where and how to train. Recognizing that mental assurance is built through attention to detail and environment reminds us that sometimes confidence requires stepping outside usual routines. Embracing this mindset can deepen trust in your preparation when you face race day challenges.",
