  "body": "In a recent feature, Jeff Galloway: Olympian, coach, and one of the most influential voices in the American running community: offered a perspective that's especially germane as we enter the race season: the marathon, and running in general, is less about chasing elite times and more about human experience and personal endurance.\n\n Galloway, known both for his competitive career and his groundbreaking run-walk training method, has long emphasized sustainable running. In this article, he reflects on how the marathon evolves with each generation, why so many runners are drawn to the distance, and how attitudes toward training, goals, and expectations can shape a runner's long-term relationship with the sport.\n\nFor runners of all places, from first-timers to seasoned competitors, his perspective resonates: running is both a personal journey and a shared culture. The takeaway isn't a new workout, but a reminder that longevity and joy in the sport often come from purposeful participation, not just performance.",
  "keyTakeaway": "Running isn't just about the time on the clock: it's about the story each runner carries. Training smarter and embracing your pace creates a relationship with running that endures beyond any single race.",
