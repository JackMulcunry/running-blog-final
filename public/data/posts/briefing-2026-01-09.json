  "body": "Melissa Jefferson-Wooden faced a crucial decision one spring evening as she contemplated skipping a key Diamond League meet to recover fully before the season's biggest championship. The meet was scheduled just four days before the world championships final in 2025, presenting her with a narrow window to balance competitive sharpness against physical freshness. Choosing to race, she accepted the risk of fatigue for the potential benefit of vital race rhythm and confidence.\n\nFor runners at any level, this scenario deepens the ongoing dialogue about how to best build towards peak performance. It reminds us that progress rarely comes from overwhelming every competition but from thoughtful navigation of which efforts to prioritize and when to pull back. The ability to assess one single event in the context of a larger goal is a mental skill valuable for sustaining consistency and energy across training cycles. This mindful approach lends itself just as much to weekend races for enjoyment as it does for those chasing personal records.",
