  "body": "Most daily trainers these days follow a familiar script: more foam, more bounce, or a carbon plate hidden somewhere. But the Topo Phantom 4 WP stands out not because it's novel, but because it solves a real runner problem: getting you out the door when the weather is terrible. \n\nWhile many waterproof shoes sacrifice feel and responsiveness for dryness, the Phantom 4 WP leans into comfort and reusable performance. The waterproofing used to keep the shoe dry genuinely works according to firsthand accounts without turning the midsole into dead weight. \n\nThat said, the tradeoffs are real. The waterproof materials add weight and trap heat and the outsole grip, especially in wet conditions, isn't at the level of a technical trail shoe. That makes the Phantom 4 WP a great companion for soggy easy and recovery runs, but less ideal if you're chasing tempo efforts or skidding across slick pavement. \n\nFor runners who struggle to stay consistent in fall or winter, a dependable waterproof triainer can be a game changer. If you can leave the house confident your feet will stay dry and comfortable, that alone improves training consistency. "
