With the clock pressing against him and fatigue setting in, his choice to time the acceleration exactly when his rivals began to tire showed remarkable judgment under immense pressure.\n\nFor runners at all levels, this highlights the importance of race awareness and patience over sheer speed. Training the mind to recognize when to conserve energy and when to push can make the difference not just in elite performances but in personal bests and consistent race outcomes.",
