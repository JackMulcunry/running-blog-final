  "body": "In the midst of the Diamond League circuit, an athlete faces decision after decision about how to balance effort and recovery across multiple meets strewn over weeks. Each competition is a moment to push for top form yet also a marker in the longer journey of a season. The constraint of limited recovery days between meets adds pressure to maintain rather than peak every time. Against this backdrop, a choice to aim for steady excellence rather than sporadic brilliance becomes central.\n\nFor runners of all levels, the challenge is similar though scales vary. Consistency involves managing daily motivation, dealing with ups and downs in form and mood, and making mindful choices to stay on track long term. It asks for a perspective beyond immediate results toward sustaining health and growth. This steady approach creates space to build resilience and adapt through changes in training and life demands, a lesson that transcends elite athletics.",
