  "body": "In track & field, coaching relationships are as central to performance as workouts and racing schedules. The news that Athing Mu and Bobby Kersee have ended their coaching partnership underscores a truth all runners can relate to: progress often requires reevaluating what serves you now, not what worked beofre.\n\nMu burst onto the scene with immense talent and cofidence, and Kersee is one of the most respected coaches in U.S. track history. But as athletes evolve, sometimes so do their needs. A parting of ways doesn't signal failure, it often signals transition. For runners chasing better times or renewed motivation, this is a reminder that progression isn't linear and that adapting your support system (training partners, coaches, routines) can be as critical as the miles you log.",
  "keyTakeaway": "Growth isn't always about staying with what's familiar, it's about finding the right structure for your current goals. Whether it's adjusting your training routine or seeking new perspectives, being honest about what you need next can make you a stronger runner in the long run.",
