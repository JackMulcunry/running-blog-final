  "body": "Carbon-plated super shoes have dominated the racing scene since Nike's Vaporfly revolution. But do they actually work for everyday runners?\n\nResearch published in Sports Medicine shows that carbon plates can improve running economy by 4% on average. That translates to roughly 2-3 minutes off a marathon time for a 3:30 marathoner.\n\nHowever, the benefits aren't universal. Runners with a forefoot strike pattern see the most gains, while heel strikers may see minimal improvement. Additionally, slower paces (9+ min/mile) reduce the mechanical advantage of the curved carbon plate.\n\nThe verdict: If you're racing and running sub-8:00 pace, carbon shoes are worth it. For easy runs and slower paces, traditional trainers are more economical and often more durable.\n\nTry this: Rent or borrow carbon shoes for a test run before committing. Your feet will tell you if the investment is worth it."
