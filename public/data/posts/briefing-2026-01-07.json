  "body": "At the 2025 Marathon Project, JP Flavin and Priscah Cherono executed pacing strategies that revealed careful balancing of effort and endurance. Their splits highlight how precise timing of surges and conservations of energy played a role in their victories on a course designed for fast times. This offers more than winning results; it provides an opportunity to examine the nuanced decisions that define an effective race day plan.\n\nFor runners of all levels, understanding how to distribute effort over long distances is essential. The winners' approach shows that pacing is not merely about speed but about adapting to conditions and responding to the race flow. Observing such performances encourages reflection on personal pacing judgment and the value of measured progression rather than all out exertion from the start.",
  "keyTakeaway": "Consider pacing as a strategic dialogue with your body and the race rather than a fixed target to hit from the outset.",
