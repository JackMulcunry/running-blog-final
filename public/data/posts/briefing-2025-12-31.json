  "body": "Races rarely unfold in perfect conditions. Wind, rain, heat, uneven footing, most runners experience more \"messy\" races than ideal ones. That reality was on full display at the Honolulu Marathon, where heavy rain and slick roads made fast times almost irrelevant.\n\nInstead of chasing PRs, the athletes who rose to the top raced the conditions. Calli Hauger-Thackery and Tsegay Weldlibanos didn't wait for perfect splits or ideal rhythm. They stayed composed, adjusted their effort, and focused on positioning rather than pace. In weather like this, patience and awareness matter more than raw fitness.\n\nFor everyday runners, this is an important reminder: race day success isn't always about execution exactly as planned. When conditions deteriorate, the goal shifts from optimization to resilience. That might mean backing off early, running tangents conservatively, or staying relaxed while others panic when splits slip.",
  "keyTakeaway": "If the weather turns against you, stop chasing the watch. Focus on competing, smooth effort, smart decisions, and controlled aggression. The runners who adapt the best often finish the strongest, even when the clock doesn't reflect it.",
