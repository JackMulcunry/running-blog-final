Running too hard every day leads to accumulated stress without adequate recovery.\n\nTry this: For the next two weeks, slow down your easy runs by 30-60 seconds per mile. You might feel like you're jogging at first, but your body will thank you with faster race times later.\n\nKey takeaway: The path to running faster often starts with running slower."
