  "body": "Elite marathoner Jordan Hasay surprised many by lining up at the Houston Marathon less than a month after her previous race, demonstrating remarkable physical resilience and mental determination. Such quick turnarounds in elite racing challenge conventional wisdom about recovery windows but also highlight the individualized nature of regaining form after a hard effort.\n\nFor everyday runners, this scenario underscores the importance of listening to one’s own body rather than following a predetermined schedule rigidly. Recovery is not solely about fixed timelines but about gauging readiness and adapting plans accordingly. Balancing the urge to push with patience ensures both progress and injury avoidance — a mindset useful whether training for a personal best or simply sustaining a healthy routine.\n\nKey Takeaway\nRecovery after demanding runs is personal and variable; prioritize how you feel over preset periods so your training remains sustainable and purposeful.",
