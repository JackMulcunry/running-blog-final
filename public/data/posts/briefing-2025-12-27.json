  "body": "Eliud Kipchoge, the greatest marathoner of all time, is back in serious training mode at 40 years old. His recent camp in Kaptagat, Kenya, has running nerds buzzing.\n\nUnlike his previous build-ups focused on high-mileage weeks (140+ miles), Kipchoge is now emphasizing quality over quantity. Recent sessions include 10x1km at sub-2:50 pace with short recovery, and tempo runs at 4:40/mile pace.\n\nThis shift mirrors emerging research on masters athletes: as we age, recovery becomes more critical than volume. Shorter, intense sessions preserve speed while reducing injury risk.\n\nFor everyday runners over 35, the lesson is clear: you don't need 70-mile weeks to stay fast. Two quality sessions per week, combined with easy mileage, can maintain or even improve your speed.\n\nTry this: Replace one easy run this week with 6x800m at 10K pace. Rest 90 seconds between reps. Quality beats quantity."
