  "body": "In 2025 Donavan Brazier faced a critical moment as he stepped onto the track for the US 800 meter title after a three year break from racing. With immense pressure to perform yet limited time to regain peak fitness the decision to prioritize steady progress rather than an immediate all out push defined his approach. His measured pace and patience in training under coach Mike Smith’s guidance allowed for a controlled return that balanced recovery with ambition.\n\nFor runners of all levels this serves as a reminder that setbacks require more than just physical readiness. The patience to allow rebuilding without rushing can be the difference between short term strain and long term success. Embracing restraint in training builds resilience and confidence in the journey back rather than fixating solely on quick results. Returning stronger often means honoring your body’s timeline and adapting your mindset accordingly.",
  "keyTakeaway": "Practice patience and gradual progression when returning from a break to rebuild strength and avoid rushing your comeback.",
