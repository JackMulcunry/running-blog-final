  "body": "At the end of every season, the Marathon, the Hurdles, and the half-mile all gives us more than times and medals, they give us new reflections. The 2025 Diamond League pulled together some of the best quotes from athletes and coaches across the year, moments that show what running really is: effort, reflection, grit, and the human side of competition.\n\nSome pulled back the curtain on pressure and doubt. Others celebrated unexpected joy in performance. Still others reminded us why athletes put their bodies through the rhythm of training, peaking, and racing. The track isn't just about who crosses first, it's about what they do when everything is on the line.\n\nFor runners out here every morning and every weekend these actions matter. They reflect the same questions you ask yourself before a tempo run, the doubts you feel before a long interval session, and the tiny victories that don't make the final results sheet.",
  "keyTakeaway": "The stories that stick aren't always just about speed and distance, they're about experience. Quotes from top athletes resonate with everyday runners because effort, emotion and resilience are universal.",
