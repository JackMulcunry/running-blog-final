  "description": "Hard interval run with strong heart rate and moderate efficiency on rolling hills",
  "detailedDescription": "The interval training session showed a fairly high average heart rate of 174.1 bpm, indicating strong cardiovascular effort consistent with high-intensity workouts. The efficiency score of 1.53 suggests some room for improvement in running economy, possibly affected by the elevation gain of 130.8 meters over the course, which may have challenged pace consistency. Maintaining a cadence of 83.3 rpm was solid, but improving turnover could further enhance efficiency on hilly terrain. Overall, the workout demonstrated good effort, but focusing on making runs smoother despite elevation changes would be beneficial.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency during intervals, specifically working to maintain smoother, more consistent strides on varied terrain to better manage elevation changes.",
