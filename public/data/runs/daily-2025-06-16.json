  "description": "Heart rate was elevated for a recovery run; aim to keep effort lighter next time for better recovery.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today was a recovery run with a moderate distance of 4 km completed in 19:27. The average heart rate of 180.6 bpm is higher than typical for a recovery run, indicating the effort might have been more intense than intended. Efficiency score at 1.69 is decent but there is room for improvement, especially when aiming to fully recover. Elevation gain was minimal at 21.7 m, contributing to a relatively flat course, which is suitable for recovery. Going forward, the goal is to keep heart rate lower during recovery days to promote better rest and adaptation.",
