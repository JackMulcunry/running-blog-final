  "date": "2025-06-16",
  "description": "Recovery run showed high heart rate and moderate efficiency; focus on lowering intensity for better rest.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's 4 km recovery run showed a high average heart rate of 180.6 bpm and a max of 193 bpm, which is quite elevated for a recovery day where a lower heart rate is typically expected. The efficiency score of 1.69 indicates moderate running economy, but there is room for improvement especially on recovery runs to better promote recovery and endurance. Elevation gain was minimal at 21.7 meters with a small elevation range, suggesting a mostly flat route, appropriate for recovery. The pace of 4:52/km is fairly brisk for a recovery run, which may explain the elevated heart rate. For future efforts, aim to reduce intensity on recovery days to better allow your body to recuperate, focusing on heart rate zones below 70-75% of max HR to enhance recovery and prepare for upcoming harder sessions.",
