  "description": "High heart rate during recovery suggests the need for a more relaxed pace to enhance recovery benefits.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today was a recovery run, and the data shows that despite the workout type intended to promote recovery, your average heart rate was quite high at 180.6 bpm with a max of 193 bpm, indicating your body was still working hard. Efficiency score at 1.69 is moderate but could improve with better pacing and recovery. The elevation gain was minimal at 21.7 m, which is typical for a recovery run and helped keep the effort steady. Average cadence of 88.5 rpm is decent, supporting a comfortable stride rate. Moving forward, focus on keeping your heart rate lower during recovery runs to maximize regeneration and improve efficiency.",
