  "description": "Elevated heart rate on easy run; focus on relaxed pace next time.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's recovery run showed a high average heart rate of 180.6 bpm and a max of 193 bpm, which is quite elevated for an easy session, suggesting you might have been pushing harder than intended. The efficiency score of 1.69 is moderate, indicating room for improvement in optimizing your running economy during recovery. With minimal elevation gain of 21.7 m, the course was relatively flat, so the elevated heart rate is unlikely due to terrain. For future recovery runs, aim to keep heart rate lower to promote better recovery and optimize your overall training balance.",
