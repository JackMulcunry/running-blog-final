  "date": "2025-06-16",
  "description": "Elevated heart rate on easy day with moderate efficiency; focus on recovery and pacing next time.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's recovery run shows a high average heart rate of 180.6 bpm and a max of 193 bpm, which is quite elevated for an easy day, suggesting the effort felt harder than intended. The efficiency score of 1.69 indicates room for improvement in running economy, potentially due to fatigue or lack of full recovery. Elevation gain was minimal at 21.7 meters over 4 km, which aligns with a recovery run's goal of low impact and easy effort.",
