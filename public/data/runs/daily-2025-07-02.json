  "date": "2025-07-02",
  "description": "Steady recovery run with moderate effort and considerable elevation.",
  "detailedDescription": "The recovery run on Wednesday maintained a moderate heart rate, averaging 168.5 bpm with a peak at 183 bpm, indicating a solid cardiovascular effort consistent with a recovery-focused workout. The efficiency score of 1.65 suggests a reasonable running form but leaves room for improvement. Elevation gain of nearly 200 meters added some challenge, which is notable for a recovery day, potentially affecting overall recovery quality. Pace and cadence were steady, but the slightly higher heart rate combined with the elevation suggests this run pushed the limit of a typical recovery effort.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on dialing back intensity during recovery runs to enhance true recovery. Prioritize keeping heart rate lower and managing elevation impact for better regeneration.",
