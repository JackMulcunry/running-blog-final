  "description": "Intense interval session with high heart rate and decent efficiency on flat terrain; focus on improving economy next.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's 4 km interval training showed a high average heart rate of 180.6 bpm with a max of 193 bpm, indicating a strong cardiovascular effort typical for intense track workouts. The efficiency score of 1.69 suggests moderate running economy, which is acceptable but leaves room for improvement. Elevation gain was minimal at 21.7 m, consistent with flat track conditions, so the challenge was driven mainly by speed and intensity rather than terrain. Given the quick pace of 4:52/km and high cadence, the workout effectively pushed aerobic capacity. Moving forward, focusing on improving efficiency while maintaining high intensity could enhance overall performance.",
