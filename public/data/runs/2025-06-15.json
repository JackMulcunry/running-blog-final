  "description": "Strong interval session with high heart rate and good efficiency; focus on maintaining speed with improved heart rate control next time.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's short 4 km interval workout showed a high average heart rate of 180.6 bpm with a max reaching 193 bpm, indicating strong cardiovascular effort typical for intense track sessions. The efficiency score of 1.69 is solid, suggesting good running economy despite the elevated heart rate. Elevation gain was modest at 21.7 m, appropriate for a track workout focusing on speed rather than hills. The cadence of 88.5 rpm aligns well with maintaining quick turnover during interval training. Overall, the session met expectations for a speed-focused workout, but aiming to slightly lower average heart rate while maintaining pace could improve efficiency further.",
