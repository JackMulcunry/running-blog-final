  "description": "Weekly training involved intense interval and hill sessions with high heart rates and variable elevation, but recovery runs showed elevated heart rates and lower efficiency, indicating potential for improved recovery and running economy.",
  "detailedDescription": "This weekâ€™s running performance shows strong cardiovascular engagement across interval and hill workouts, with average heart rates consistently elevated, ranging from 162 to 174 bpm during intense sessions. This is accompanied by high max heart rates, peaking at 200 bpm during hill training, confirming vigorous efforts. However, recovery days display somewhat elevated heart rates and lower running efficiency, suggesting the body may still be adjusting to training loads and could benefit from a more relaxed approach on those days. Efficiency scores fluctuate notably, with interval workouts scoring moderately (1.54 to 2.88), but with ideal efficiency expected to be higher during less intense runs. Elevation gain varies significantly: minimal on interval days, emphasizing speed work on flat terrain, while recovery and hill running days include considerable elevation gains (up to 183.7 m), contributing to slower paces and influencing cardiovascular demand. The overall pattern highlights strong intensity and effort but reveals areas to optimize recovery runs and running economy to enhance performance sustainably.",
  "type": "weekly",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency during recovery runs to better support cardiovascular recovery and overall training adaptation. Slowing the pace and controlling effort on these days may help reduce fatigue and enhance performance in subsequent workouts.",
