  "date": "2025-06-18",
  "description": "Recovery run challenged by elevation and elevated heart rate, pointing to residual fatigue from recent workouts.",
  "detailedDescription": "The recovery run showed a moderately elevated average heart rate of 168.6 bpm, which is somewhat high for a recovery effort, indicating the body might still be experiencing fatigue from recent intense sessions. The running efficiency score of 1.55 is decent but suggests room for improvement, especially during a recovery run when efficiency should ideally be higher due to lower intensity. The elevation gain of 183.7 m added extra challenge to the run, contributing to a slower pace and reduced average speed. Overall, the body's response to recovery was mixed, with heart rate and efficiency implying the need for a more relaxed effort on recovery days.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on lowering heart rate during recovery runs to allow better recovery and improve overall running efficiency. Aim to keep effort truly easy for more effective muscle repair and energy replenishment.",
