  "date": "2025-06-18",
  "description": "Steady intervals with solid effort, moderate elevation, and efficiency that could improve.",
  "detailedDescription": "The long form interval training on Tuesday showed a moderately high average heart rate of 173.5 bpm, peaking at 188 bpm, indicating strong cardiovascular effort consistent with the workout type. The running efficiency score of 1.94 is decent but suggests room for improvement in technique to maximize energy use over longer intervals. Elevation gain was minimal at 24.7 m, meaning the terrain was mostly flat, allowing focus on sustaining pace and intensity. The pace of 4:55/km aligns with the effort expected for this type of workout, though average speed was a bit low, possibly indicating moments of fatigue.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency today. Enhancing technique during long form intervals can help conserve energy and maintain a stronger pace throughout the workout.",
