  "date": "2025-06-26",
  "description": "Strong effort on hills with solid heart rate and efficiency.",
  "detailedDescription": "The hill workout on Thursday showed solid effort with an average heart rate of 168 bpm, indicating a high level of cardiovascular exertion, which is expected for this type of workout. The efficiency score of 1.93 suggests a good running form despite the challenging elevation changes. The modest elevation gain of 16.3 meters over a short distance aligns well with hill training goals, adding strength and power to the run. The pace was steady, reflecting control even on inclines.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on slightly increasing cadence to improve running economy and speed during hill workouts. Small gains in turnover can lead to better efficiency and overall performance.",
