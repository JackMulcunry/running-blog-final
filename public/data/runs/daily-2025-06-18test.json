  "date": "2025-06-18",
  "description": "Strong heart rate effort with moderate efficiency on longer intervals.",
  "detailedDescription": "The long form interval training on Tuesday showed a high average heart rate of 173.5 bpm, which is expected for this type of demanding workout. Efficient running was moderate with a score of 1.94, indicating some room for improvement in maintaining form during sustained efforts. Elevation gain was minimal at 24.7 meters, so terrain factors had a limited effect on performance. The pace was consistent with a solid effort throughout the 4.71 km distance, but the average speed suggests some room to increase intensity in future sessions.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency during longer interval sessions to better sustain pace and reduce fatigue. Small adjustments in form could enhance overall performance and endurance.",
