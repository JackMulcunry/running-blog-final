  "description": "Mixed week with strong interval efforts, moderate heart rates, variable efficiency, and challenging hills impacting performance.",
  "detailedDescription": "This week's running performance showed diverse efforts across different workout types. The interval training sessions exhibited strong cardiovascular engagement with average heart rates ranging from 163 to 168 bpm and maximum heart rates up to 185 bpm, reflecting appropriately intense efforts. However, running efficiency scores fluctuated, with lower values seen during flat treadmill runs and slightly better but not optimal scores during intervals and hill sessions. Elevation gain was a significant factor in the hill workout, contributing to increased cardiovascular demand and slightly reduced efficiency. Cadence hovered around the low 80s rpm, suggesting some room for improvement to enhance running economy, especially during recovery and interval days. Overall, moderating intensity on recovery days and focusing on improving cadence could help maximize efficiency and ensure better recovery, while maintaining strong effort on intervals and hill runs contributes to cardiovascular and strength gains.",
  "type": "weekly",
  "goal": "Focus on improving cadence consistency across all runs, especially recovery days, to enhance running efficiency and reduce fatigue.",
