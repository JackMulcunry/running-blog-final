  "title": "Tuesday Treadmill Effort",
  "date": "2025-07-01",
  "description": "Steady treadmill run with solid effort and room for efficiency gains.",
  "detailedDescription": "This Tuesday's treadmill run showed a relatively high average heart rate of 170.3 bpm, suggesting a strong cardiovascular effort during the session. The efficiency score of 1.78 reflects moderate running efficiency, which could be improved for better performance and energy use. Elevation gain was minimal at 20.1 meters, consistent with treadmill running and the goal of maintaining steady effort despite limited incline variation. Overall, the run maintained a steady pace of 5:06/km under controlled conditions, providing a solid workout despite heat constraints.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency by working on form and cadence during treadmill sessions. Enhancing efficiency can lead to better speed and reduced fatigue in future runs.",
