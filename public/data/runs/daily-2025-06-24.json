  "date": "2025-06-24",
  "description": "Challenging treadmill run with steady effort but low efficiency.",
  "detailedDescription": "The treadmill run today showed a relatively high average heart rate of 161 bpm, indicating a challenging effort despite the slower pace and low speeds. The elevation was flat, as expected on a treadmill, so no additional strain from hills was present. The efficiency score of 0.7 suggests room for improvement in running economy, possibly due to the slower cadence and reduced speed. Given the workout's nature on a treadmill during extreme heat, it's understandable that pace and efficiency took a backseat to maintaining consistent effort and safety.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency today. Working on cadence and form even during slower treadmill runs can help enhance overall running economy and readiness for upcoming outdoor workouts.",
