  "date": "2025-06-24",
  "description": "Recovery run with elevated heart rate and average efficiency.",
  "detailedDescription": "The recovery run on Saturday showed a moderately elevated average heart rate of 165.8 bpm, which is somewhat high for a recovery workout, indicating the body might still be under some fatigue from the weekâ€™s training. The efficiency score of 1.72 suggests room for improvement in running economy during this lower-intensity effort. With no elevation gain, the pace was steady, but cadence was slightly lower than ideal, potentially affecting overall smoothness and efficiency. Given the purpose of recovery runs to promote active recovery and facilitate muscle repair, better control of intensity and cadence could enhance the benefits of this session.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on controlling heart rate during recovery runs to better facilitate recovery. Aim to maintain a comfortable pace and improve cadence to enhance running efficiency.",
