  "date": "2025-06-24",
  "description": "Moderate effort treadmill run with steady heart rate and room to improve efficiency.",
  "detailedDescription": "The Saturday treadmill run showed a relatively high average heart rate of 161 bpm, indicating a moderate to intense effort for this steady-state workout. The efficiency score of 0.7 suggests room for improvement in running economy, which is common on the treadmill compared to outdoor runs. No elevation change was recorded, making it a flat and controlled session. The pace was steady but on the slower side, pointing to a recovery or endurance focus after the more intense hill and interval sessions earlier in the week.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency in treadmill sessions by working on form and cadence, especially during flat runs where pacing can be controlled precisely.",
