  "description": "Challenging hill session with solid effort but moderate efficiency.",
  "detailedDescription": "The hill workout demonstrated a strong cardiovascular response with an average heart rate of 162.4 bpm, peaking at 200 bpm, which indicates high exertion typical for hill training. The elevation gain of 101.5 meters over a relatively short distance contributed to the challenging nature of the run. The efficiency score of 1.54 suggests moderate running efficiency; however, the slower average speed relative to max speed indicates room for smoother pacing and energy utilization on inclines.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency on hills by maintaining a steadier pace and optimizing cadence to conserve energy during elevation gains.",
