  "description": "High-intensity intervals with solid efficiency and controlled elevation. Heart rate shows strong effort.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's short interval workout showed a strong cardiovascular effort with an average heart rate of 171.5 bpm and a max of 189 bpm, indicating you pushed hard during the bursts. The efficiency score of 1.84 suggests a good balance of speed and energy use, which is promising for interval training. The minimal elevation gain of 22.6 meters over a short distance kept the focus on speed rather than climbing. Maintaining this effort level is great for improving anaerobic capacity. For upcoming sessions, aim to keep cadence consistent while gradually improving speed without overly spiking heart rate.",
