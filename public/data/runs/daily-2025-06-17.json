  "description": "Strong interval effort with room for efficiency gains",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's short interval workout showed a solid effort with a high average heart rate of 171.5 bpm, peaking at 189 bpm, which is expected during intense track sessions. The efficiency score of 1.84 indicates moderate running economy; there is room to improve form and energy use especially during intervals. The elevation gain was minimal at 22.6 m, so elevation likely did not impact performance. Given it's Monday's focused interval session, the pace of 4:34/km is decent, but there is potential to push harder or improve consistency in future workouts. A goal could be to maintain a similar pace with a lower heart rate or to increase speed while keeping efficiency steady.",
