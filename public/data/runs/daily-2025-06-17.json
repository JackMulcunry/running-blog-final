  "description": "Strong intensity with solid efficiency and manageable elevation on a Monday interval session.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's short interval workout showed a high average heart rate of 171.5 bpm with a max of 189 bpm, indicating you were pushing hard during efforts as expected. Your efficiency score of 1.84 is solid, showing good running economy despite the elevated heart rate. Elevation gain was minimal at 22.6 m over 4.1 km, so terrain likely didn't impact performance much. The pace of 4:34/km aligns well with an intense, short interval session. Overall, you maintained intensity and controlled effort well. Going forward, focus on maintaining this efficiency while managing your recovery to avoid overtraining.",
