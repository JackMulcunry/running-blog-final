  "description": "Strong effort with high heart rate; efficiency steady; minimal elevation impact during long intervals.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's long form interval workout showed a solid effort with a high average heart rate of 173.5 bpm, indicating strong cardiovascular engagement throughout the session. The max heart rate reaching 188 bpm confirms you pushed yourself during intervals. Efficiency at 1.94 is respectable but suggests there’s room to improve stride and pace consistency. The modest elevation gain of 24.7 meters over 4.7 km had minimal impact on performance, keeping the focus on pace and endurance. Given it’s a Tuesday long interval day, maintaining this effort while further improving efficiency will help boost overall speed and stamina.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency today. Enhancing technique during long form intervals can help conserve energy and maintain a stronger pace throughout the workout.",
