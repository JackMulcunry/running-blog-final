  "description": "Solid interval effort with good heart rate intensity but room to enhance running efficiency and cadence.",
  "detailedDescription": "The interval training session demonstrated a solid effort with an average heart rate of 168 bpm and a maximum reaching 185 bpm, indicating strong cardiovascular engagement appropriate for high-intensity efforts. The running efficiency score of 1.93 is decent but leaves room for improvement to maximize energy use during intervals. Elevation gain was minimal at 16.3 meters, keeping the focus on speed and recovery rather than climbing. The cadence averaged 80.8 rpm, which is slightly on the lower side for intervals and could be optimized for better turnover.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency and cadence during intervals to enhance overall speed and energy utilization. Slightly quicker leg turnover could help maintain pace with less fatigue.",
