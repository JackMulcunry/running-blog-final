  "description": "Week featured intense intervals and hills with high heart rates and moderate efficiency, highlighting the need to balance effort and recovery for improved running economy.",
  "detailedDescription": "The week of training highlights a consistent focus on interval and hill workouts with varied cardiovascular demands and efficiency scores. Early in the week, average heart rates remained high, particularly on Monday and Tuesday, reflecting intense interval sessions that pushed cardiovascular limits. Efficiency scores during these runs were decent but displayed opportunities for improvement, especially in maintaining energy economy through the intervals. Midweek recovery efforts were challenged by relatively high heart rates and significant elevation gain, suggesting residual fatigue and the added strain of hilly terrain impacting true recovery quality. Thursday's hill workout further demonstrated high exertion with elevated heart rates and moderate efficiency, emphasizing the energetic cost of elevation gain during shorter runs. The final reported interval session showed a modest efficiency score despite solid cardiovascular response, indicating potential for better running economy. Elevation gains were notable midweek and during the hill workout but minimal on interval days, aligning well with training goals focused alternately on intensity and recovery. Overall, managing heart rate response and enhancing efficiency, particularly on recovery and high-intensity days, will be key for optimizing performance and reducing fatigue accumulation.",
