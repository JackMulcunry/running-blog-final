  "description": "High-intensity interval training with strong heart rate effort and moderate efficiency on a flat course.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's interval training was quite intense, as reflected by the high average heart rate of 171.5 bpm and a max heart rate reaching 189 bpm, indicating strong cardiovascular effort. The efficiency score of 1.84 suggests a decent but improvable energy use during the workout. Elevation gain was minimal at 22.6 meters, which aligns well with the focus on speed rather than hill work. The pace of 4:34/km over 4.1 km shows good speed for a Monday interval session. Going forward, aiming to maintain or slightly improve efficiency while managing heart rate during high-intensity sessions could enhance overall performance.",
