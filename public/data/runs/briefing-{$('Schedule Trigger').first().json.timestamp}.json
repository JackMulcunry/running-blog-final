  "body": "LSU Teammates comment on how they're around and competing with people breaking \"real\" records. This type of record requires a different level of teamwork and coordination, something not commonly seen in track. Breaking a record like this although it may be viewed as \"goofy\" or not a real record shouldn't be viewed in the same light as a typical track record. It gives extra depth to a field that is usually very solo and a record falling is credited to a single individual rather than a pair, mastering a unique skill."
