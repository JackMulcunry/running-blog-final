  "description": "High heart rate on recovery run, maintain lower intensity next time.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's recovery run showed a high average heart rate of 180.6 bpm and a max of 193 bpm, which is unusually elevated for a recovery session, indicating possible fatigue or residual intensity from earlier workouts. The efficiency score of 1.69 suggests moderate running economy, but there is room for improvement, especially on recovery days. Elevation gain was minimal at 21.7 meters over 4 km, aligning well with the recovery run's goal to keep effort light and avoid strain. Moving forward, the focus should be on maintaining lower heart rates during recovery runs to promote better recovery and prepare for more intense sessions later in the week.",
