  "date": "2025-06-15",
  "description": "High heart rate despite easy pace; focus on true recovery",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's recovery run covered 4 km in 19:27 with a pace of 4:52/km. The average heart rate was quite high at 180.6 bpm with a max of 193 bpm, which is elevated for a recovery session and suggests insufficient resting or residual fatigue from the week. Efficiency score at 1.69 indicates moderate running economy, but there is room to improve, especially on recovery days. Elevation gain was minimal (21.7 m) with a narrow elevation range, which is appropriate for a recovery run and helped maintain lower intensity. Moving forward, focusing on lowering heart rate during recovery runs and enhancing running efficiency will support better overall performance.",
