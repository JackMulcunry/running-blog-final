  "date": "2025-06-15",
  "description": "Recovery run heart rate was high; aim for easier effort next time to promote better recovery and improve efficiency.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's recovery run showed a high average heart rate of 180.6 bpm with a max of 193 bpm, which is quite elevated for an easy day and might suggest insufficient recovery or residual fatigue from the week's more intense sessions. The efficiency score of 1.69 is moderate, indicating there's room to improve running economy, especially on recovery days when maintaining relaxed form is key. Elevation gain was minimal at 21.7 m, consistent with a recovery run, which typically focuses on easy effort rather than elevation challenges. Going forward, the goal is to keep heart rate lower on recovery runs to enhance recovery and improve efficiency.",
