  "description": "High heart rate during recovery run with moderate efficiency and minimal elevation.",
  "detailedDescription": "Today's recovery run showed a high average heart rate of 180.6 bpm, which is quite elevated for a recovery day suggesting you might not have fully recovered from the previous hard workouts. The efficiency score of 1.69 is moderate, indicating your running form and energy use could improve slightly to become more economical. Elevation gain was minimal at 21.7 meters, keeping the run relatively easy on the legs as intended. For future recovery runs, aim to keep the heart rate lower to maximize recovery benefits and improve overall performance.",
