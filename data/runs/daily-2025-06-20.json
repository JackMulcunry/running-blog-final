  "title": "Friday Intervals Pace",
  "date": "2025-06-20",
  "description": "Steady interval session with moderate efficiency and strong heart rate effort on flat terrain.",
  "detailedDescription": "The interval training on this Friday showed a solid effort with an average heart rate of 164.7 bpm and a maximum of 186 bpm, indicating good cardiovascular exertion typical for this workout type. The elevation gain was minimal at 19 meters, suggesting the terrain was fairly flat, which suits interval work aiming for speed and consistency. However, the efficiency score of 2.88 is somewhat modest, reflecting there is room for improvement in running economy during high-intensity efforts.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency during interval training by incorporating drills and form work. Enhancing efficiency will help maintain pace with less effort and reduce fatigue in future sessions.",
