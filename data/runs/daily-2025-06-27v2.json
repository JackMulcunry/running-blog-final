  "description": "Strong heart rate effort with moderate efficiency on Friday intervals.",
  "detailedDescription": "The interval training on Friday showed a high average heart rate of 170.3 bpm, peaking at 186 bpm, indicating strong cardiovascular effort consistent with the demands of speed work. The efficiency score of 2.67 suggests moderate running economy during intense intervals, but there is room for improvement to optimize performance under fatigue. The elevation gain was minimal at 16.1 meters, appropriate for a track workout focused on speed rather than hill climbing.",
  "type": "daily",
  "goal": "Focus on improving running efficiency during high-intensity intervals. Enhancing form and economy can help sustain faster paces with less effort.",
